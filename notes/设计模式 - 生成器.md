## 5. 生成器（Builder）

### Motivation

The more complex an application is the complexity of classes and objects used increases. Complex objects are made of parts produced by other objects that need special care when being built. An application might need a mechanism for building complex objects that is independent from the ones that make up the object. If this is the problem you are being confronted with, you might want to try using the Builder (or Adaptive Builder) design pattern.

This pattern allows a client object to construct a complex object by specifying only its type and content, being shielded from the details related to the object‘s representation. This way the construction process can be used to create different representations. The logic of this process is isolated form the actual steps used in creating the complex object, so the process can be used again to create a different object form the same set of simple objects as the first one.


### Intent

封装一个对象的构造过程，并允许按步骤构造。

> - Defines an instance for creating an object but letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
> - Refers to the newly created object through a common interface



### Class Diagram

The Builder design pattern uses the Factory Builder pattern to decide which concrete class to initiate in order to build the desired type of object, as we will see below in the UML diagram:

<div align="center"> <img src="../assets/builder-pattern.png"/> </div><br>

The participants classes in this pattern are:
- The **Builder** class specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a Product object.
- The **ConcreteBuilder** constructs and puts together parts of the product by implementing the Builder interface. It defines and keeps track of the representation it creates and provides an interface for saving the product.
- The **Director** class constructs the complex object using the Builder interface.
- The **Product** represents the complex object that is being built.

The client, that may be either another object or the actual client that calls the main() method of the application, initiates the Builder and Director class. The Builder represents the complex object that needs to be built in terms of simpler objects and types. The constructor in the Director class receives a Builder object as a parameter from the Client and is responsible for calling the appropriate methods of the Builder class. In order to provide the Client with an interface for all concrete Builders, the Builder class should be an abstract one. This way you can add new types of complex objects by only defining the structure and reusing the logic for the actual construction process. The Client is the only one that needs to know about the new types, the Director needing to know which methods of the Builder to call.

### Implementation

The following example discusses the case of a text converting application:

<div align="center"> <img src="../assets/builder-pattern-example.png"/> </div><br>

The Client needs to convert a document from RTF format to ASCII format. There for, it calls the method createASCIIText that takes as a parameter the document that will be converted. This method calls the concrete builder, ASCIIConverter, that extends the Builder, TextConverter, and overrides its two methods for converting characters and paragraphs, and also the Director, RTFReader, that parses the document and calls the builder's methods depending on the type of token encountered. The product, the ASCIIText, is built step by step, by appending converted characters.


````java
//Abstract Builder
class abstract class TextConverter{
	abstract void convertCharacter(char c);
	abstract void convertParagraph();
}
// Product
class ASCIIText{
	public void append(char c){ //Implement the code here }
}
//Concrete Builder
class ASCIIConverter extends TextConverter{
	ASCIIText asciiTextObj;//resulting product

	/*converts a character to target representation and appends to the resulting*/
	object void convertCharacter(char c){
		char asciiChar = new Character(c).charValue();
			//gets the ascii character
		asciiTextObj.append(asciiChar);
	}
	void convertParagraph(){}
	ASCIIText getResult(){
		return asciiTextObj;
	}
}
//This class abstracts the document object
class Document{
	static int value;
	char token;
	public char getNextToken(){
		//Get the next token
		return token;
	}
}
//Director
class RTFReader{
	private static final char EOF='0'; //Delimiter for End of File
	final char CHAR='c';
	final char PARA='p';
	char t;
	TextConverter builder;
	RTFReader(TextConverter obj){
		builder=obj;
	}
	void parseRTF(Document doc){
		while ((t=doc.getNextToken())!= EOF){
			switch (t){
				case CHAR: builder.convertCharacter(t);
				case PARA: builder.convertParagraph();
			}
		}
	}
}
//Client
public class Client{
	void createASCIIText(Document doc){
		ASCIIConverter asciiBuilder = new ASCIIConverter();
		RTFReader rtfReader = new RTFReader(asciiBuilder);
		rtfReader.parseRTF(doc);
		ASCIIText asciiText = asciiBuilder.getResult();
	}
	public static void main(String args[]){
		Client client=new Client();
		Document doc=new Document();
		client.createASCIIText(doc);
		system.out.println("This is an example of Builder Pattern");
	}
}

以下是一个简易的 StringBuilder 实现，参考了 JDK 1.8 源码。

```java
public class AbstractStringBuilder {
    protected char[] value;

    protected int count;

    public AbstractStringBuilder(int capacity) {
        count = 0;
        value = new char[capacity];
    }

    public AbstractStringBuilder append(char c) {
        ensureCapacityInternal(count + 1);
        value[count++] = c;
        return this;
    }

    private void ensureCapacityInternal(int minimumCapacity) {
        // overflow-conscious code
        if (minimumCapacity - value.length > 0)
            expandCapacity(minimumCapacity);
    }

    void expandCapacity(int minimumCapacity) {
        int newCapacity = value.length * 2 + 2;
        if (newCapacity - minimumCapacity < 0)
            newCapacity = minimumCapacity;
        if (newCapacity < 0) {
            if (minimumCapacity < 0) // overflow
                throw new OutOfMemoryError();
            newCapacity = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        value = Arrays.copyOf(value, newCapacity);
    }
}
```

```java
public class StringBuilder extends AbstractStringBuilder {
    public StringBuilder() {
        super(16);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        // Create a copy, don't share the array
        return new String(value, 0, count);
    }
}
```

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        final int count = 26;
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            sb.append((char) ('a' + i));
        }
        System.out.println(sb.toString());
    }
}
```

Applicability & Examples

Builder Pattern is used when:
- the creation algorithm of a complex object is independent from the parts that actually compose the object
- the system needs to allow different representations for the objects that are being built
