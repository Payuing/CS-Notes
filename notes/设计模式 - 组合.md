## [组合 (Composite)](https://www.oodesign.com/composite-pattern.html)

### Motivation

There are times when a program needs to manipulate a tree data structure and it is necessary to treat both Branches as well as Leaf Nodes uniformly. Consider for example a program that manipulates a file system. A file system is a tree structure that contains Branches which are Folders as well as Leaf nodes which are Files. Note that a folder object usually contains one or more file or folder objects and thus is a complex object where a file is a simple object. Note also that since files and folders have many operations and attributes in common, such as moving and copying a file or a folder, listing file or folder attributes such as file name and size, it would be easier and more convenient to treat both file and folder objects uniformly by defining a File System Resource Interface.


### Intent

将对象组合成树形结构来表示“整体/部分”层次关系，允许用户以相同的方式处理单独对象和组合对象。

> - The intent of this pattern is to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
> - Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.



### Class Diagram

组件（Component）类是组合类（Composite）和叶子类（Leaf）的父类，可以把组合类看成是树的中间节点。

组合对象拥有一个或者多个组件对象，因此组合对象的操作可以委托给组件对象去处理，而组件对象可以是另一个组合对象或者叶子对象。

- **Component** - Component is the abstraction for leafs and composites. It defines the interface that must be implemented by the objects in the composition. For example a file system resource defines move, copy, rename, and getSize methods for files and folders.
- **Leaf** - Leafs are objects that have no children. They implement services described by the Component interface. For example a file object implements move, copy, rename, as well as getSize methods which are related to the Component interface.
- **Composite** - A Composite stores child components in addition to implementing methods defined by the component interface. Composites implement methods defined in the Component interface by delegating to child components. In addition composites provide additional methods for adding, removing, as well as getting components.
- **Client** - The client manipulates objects in the hierarchy using the component interface.

A client has a reference to a tree data structure and needs to perform operations on all nodes independent of the fact that a node might be a branch or a leaf. The client simply obtains reference to the required node using the component interface, and deals with the node using this interface; it doesn't matter if the node is a composite or a leaf.




### Implementation

```java
public abstract class Component {
    protected String name;

    public Component(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void print() {
        print(0);
    }

    abstract void print(int level);

    abstract public void add(Component component);

    abstract public void remove(Component component);
}
```

```java
public class Composite extends Component {

    private List<Component> child;

    public Composite(String name) {
        super(name);
        child = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    @Override
    void print(int level) {
        for (int i = 0; i < level; i++) {
            System.out.print("--");
        }
        System.out.println("Composite:" + name);
        for (Component component : child) {
            component.print(level + 1);
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void add(Component component) {
        child.add(component);
    }

    @Override
    public void remove(Component component) {
        child.remove(component);
    }
}
```

```java
public class Leaf extends Component {
    public Leaf(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    void print(int level) {
        for (int i = 0; i < level; i++) {
            System.out.print("--");
        }
        System.out.println("left:" + name);
    }

    @Override
    public void add(Component component) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); // 牺牲透明性换取单一职责原则，这样就不用考虑是叶子节点还是组合节点
    }

    @Override
    public void remove(Component component) {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
    }
}
```

```java
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Composite root = new Composite("root");
        Component node1 = new Leaf("1");
        Component node2 = new Composite("2");
        Component node3 = new Leaf("3");
        root.add(node1);
        root.add(node2);
        root.add(node3);
        Component node21 = new Leaf("21");
        Component node22 = new Composite("22");
        node2.add(node21);
        node2.add(node22);
        Component node221 = new Leaf("221");
        node22.add(node221);
        root.print();
    }
}
```

```html
Composite:root
--left:1
--Composite:2
----left:21
----Composite:22
------left:221
--left:3
```

### Consequences

- The composite pattern defines class hierarchies consisting of primitive objects and composite objects. Primitive objects can be composed into more complex objects, which in turn can be composed.
- Clients treat primitive and composite objects uniformly through a component interface which makes client code simple.
- Adding new components can be easy and client code does not need to be changed since client deals with the new components through the component interface
